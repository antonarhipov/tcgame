# Unluck Design 🎯
•	Trigger frequency: 10% per step (independent roll).
•	Effect: Reduces the positive gain of that step by a factor.
•	Narrative: Always contextual — something in the startup world sabotages your otherwise solid choice.

# Formula Update with Unluck ⚖️

## Existing (simplified)
score_raw = wR*R + wU*U + wS*S + wC*C + wI*I
meter = f(score_raw) + small_noise

## With Unluck
•	When triggered:
•	Apply penalty factor to the step delta only.
•	Don’t erase overall progress — just cut the gain for that step.

if Unluck:
    step_delta = step_delta * luck_factor
    // luck_factor between 0.4 and 0.7

•	So:
	•	You still move forward, but visibly less.
	•	Meter shows “red spark” animation + overlay explanation text.

## Example
•	Step 2B (Onboarding emails): normally ΔC = +8.
•	Unluck event: “Onboarding emails went to spam.”
•	Apply factor 0.5 → ΔC = +4.
•	Narrative: “You set up great onboarding, but Gmail decided your AI Cofounder is a Nigerian Prince. Gains halved.”

# Gameplay Explanation 🎮

When Unluck happens:
•	Show a popup balloon in the agent console with snarky text.
•	Example:
“Oh, brutal! You picked the right feature, but the payment processor froze your account. Gains cut in half.”

Make the Unluck events tightly context-aware, so each one matches the specific option the player picked. This way, the game feels “personal” when bad luck hits.

## Step 1 — Early Maturity

Choice A: Add subscription billing
•	“Stripe pushed a surprise API change — half your subscriptions failed. Gains halved.”
•	“Billing portal worked… until compliance flagged you. Revenue paused until lawyers finish their coffee.”

Choice B: Investor dashboard
•	“Dashboard looked slick… then crashed five minutes before your board call. Investors stared at 404s.”
•	“Charts were perfect — until the data pipeline broke and showed churn at 200%. Panic.”

## Step 2 — First Customers

Choice A: Landing page
•	“Your landing page looked great… until Google Ads flagged it as spam. Zero clicks.”
•	“Competitor bought your domain typo — half your leads are now on ‘aicofounderr.com.’ Brutal.”

Choice B: Onboarding emails
•	“Emails queued nicely… straight into Gmail’s spam folder. New users ghosted.”
•	“AWS SES flagged your emails as ‘suspicious activity.’ Welcome sequence = blocked.”

•	“Launch was hyped — but Slack went down the same day. Everyone blamed you.”

Choice B: Customer analytics
•	“Analytics dashboard impressed — until investors misread the churn chart. Panic ensued.”
•	“Charts worked — until a timezone bug doubled daily active users. Nobody trusts numbers now.”

## Step 4 — Viral Spike

Choice A: Autoscale infra
•	“Autoscaling kicked in — and wiped half your staging data. Chaos at scale.”
•	“Traffic surge handled — but you forgot rate limits. Bots ate your free tier.”

Choice B: AI support chatbot
•	“Chatbot replied honestly: ‘Have you tried shutting down your company?’ Support tickets exploded.”
•	“Bot answered everything — then went offline mid-surge. Customers angry, humans swamped.”

## Step 5 — Global Expansion

Choice A: Multilingual support
•	“Great translations — except Japanese tagline now reads: ‘Hire a Goat as Cofounder.’”
•	“Spanish users thrilled… until accents broke the UI. Half the text boxes overflow.”

Choice B: International payments
•	“Payments launched globally — then processor froze funds for ‘suspicious founder activity.’ Customers paid, you didn’t.”
